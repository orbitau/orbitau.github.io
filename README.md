<span>Orbitau - Seven Deadly Sins</span>, a fantasy game inspired by
		Norse Mythology and the Seven Deadly Sins, auspiciously provides players
		with new experiences based on well-known legends.<br/><br/>
		In Orbitau, players will directly participate in the Demon - God war
		with the familiar
		<span>role-playing and turn-based strategy</span> gameplay in a magical
		land of mixed reality and fiction created by blockchain technology. And
		the rewards are materially valuable, not just symbolic victories.
